    "## Summary Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "##### üìä Continuous Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average age is around 42, with a balanced spread (18‚Äì66) and no strong skew.\n",
    "* This indicates a representative adult population with both younger and older insured individuals.\n",
    "* Since premiums typically rise with age, the wide coverage ensures age remains an important predictor for risk segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heights center around 168 cm with little skew, spanning from 145 cm to 188 cm.\n",
    "* Height on its own is less meaningful, but in combination with weight it helps calculate BMI.\n",
    "* BMI can reveal obesity risks, which directly influence health outcomes and hence premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average weight is \\~77 kg, moderately right-skewed, with some heavier outliers up to 132 kg.\n",
    "* This suggests a portion of the population is overweight/obese, which may correlate with lifestyle diseases.\n",
    "* Higher weight relative to height (BMI) should be treated as a health risk driver in premium pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Major Surgeries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most people have 0‚Äì1 surgeries, but a few report up to 3, with a skew toward fewer surgeries.\n",
    "* This distribution reflects that surgeries are relatively rare but highly impactful.\n",
    "* Prior surgeries indicate higher medical risk, so this variable likely adds strong weight in premium adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Premium Price**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average premium is \\~‚Çπ24,300, ranging from ‚Çπ15,000 to ‚Çπ40,000, with slight right skew.\n",
    "* This shows a structured pricing band with no extreme outliers, reflecting standard underwriting rules.\n",
    "* Premium is sensitive to medical history and demographics, so this distribution provides the baseline cost for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ‚öñÔ∏è Binary Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diabetes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Around 42% of the insured population has diabetes.\n",
    "* This is a significant portion, showing diabetes is common in the dataset.\n",
    "* Since diabetes is a chronic condition, it adds substantial long-term cost, raising premium risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blood Pressure Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nearly 47% report hypertension issues.\n",
    "* This high prevalence indicates cardiovascular risks are widespread.\n",
    "* Strong predictor of claims, so critical for premium modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any Transplants**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only about 6% have undergone transplants.\n",
    "* Rare but very high-risk cases.\n",
    "* Even though the sample is small, transplant history justifies very high premium loadings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any Chronic Diseases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* About 18% report chronic diseases other than diabetes/BP.\n",
    "* Reflects a smaller but costly subset of policyholders.\n",
    "* Inclusion of this variable sharpens risk categorization for sustained medical expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known Allergies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 21% report allergies.\n",
    "* Allergies can range from minor to severe, but in aggregate they suggest higher medical sensitivity.\n",
    "* May serve as a secondary risk factor, moderately influencing premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "**History of Cancer in Family**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Around 12% have family cancer history.\n",
    "* This indicates potential genetic predisposition to high-cost illnesses.\n",
    "* Even as a family history (not diagnosis), insurers may treat this as an early-warning risk flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age is evenly spread across adulthood, with no extreme skew, indicating balanced representation of young and older individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Height follows a near-normal spread around 168 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weight shows right skew, reflecting a notable overweight/obese subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Premium prices cluster between ‚Çπ15k‚Äì‚Çπ30k, with a few higher outliers, showing standard pricing with risk-based adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age, height, and weight are fairly compact with few visible outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Premium prices show a wide range, with several higher-end outliers beyond ‚Çπ35k.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This suggests that while demographics are stable, premiums vary more due to health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outliers in premium highlight customers with higher risk profiles driving up costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diabetes and blood pressure problems affect a large share of the population (40‚Äì45%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transplants are rare (\\~6%) but critical for cost implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allergies and chronic diseases affect about 20%, while family cancer history is at 12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These conditions add significant heterogeneity in health risk, influencing premium differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nearly half have no surgeries, and \\~38% report exactly one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple surgeries (2‚Äì3) are rare but indicate high medical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This reflects that surgeries are infrequent events but carry heavy cost weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The skew suggests the variable is important for identifying high-cost outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "##### BMI Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution is well spread, with \\~32% normal, 33% overweight, and 31% obese.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very few fall under the underweight group (4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* High overweight/obesity rates suggest lifestyle-related risks are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since BMI strongly correlates with chronic diseases, it is a major premium driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Age Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "* Largest share of insured falls in the 18‚Äì29 and 40‚Äì49 ranges (\\~24% each).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Older groups (50‚Äì59 and 60+) are smaller in count (\\~32% combined).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This suggests a balanced pool with both young, low-risk customers and older, high-risk customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The age group spread ensures premiums must adjust strongly with age bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Premiums rise steadily with age, starting from an average of \\~‚Çπ16.4k in the 18‚Äì29 group to \\~‚Çπ28.8k in the 60+ group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This shows a strong positive relationship between age and insurance cost, reflecting that older individuals are considered riskier due to higher likelihood of health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It highlights age as one of the most powerful predictors in premium estimation, making age-group-based pricing essential for accurate risk adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individuals without chronic diseases pay lower average premiums (~‚Çπ23.7k) compared to those with chronic conditions (~‚Çπ27.1k).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This indicates that chronic illnesses significantly increase perceived health risk, leading insurers to charge higher premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It reinforces the importance of medical history in premium pricing, as chronic conditions signal sustained long-term healthcare costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most individuals with chronic diseases (156 out of 178) do not report a family cancer history, while only 22 report both risk factors together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This shows that chronic conditions and family cancer history are largely independent, with limited overlap in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From a premium perspective, the small group having both factors represents a concentrated high-risk segment that could justify significantly higher pricing adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age shows the strongest correlation with premium (0.70), confirming it as the dominant driver of insurance pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Medical risk factors such as transplants (0.29), number of surgeries (0.26), and chronic diseases (0.21) also have notable positive relationships, indicating higher health burdens push premiums upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lifestyle and genetic indicators like weight, BMI, blood pressure, and family cancer history show weaker correlations, but still contribute incremental risk signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allergies and height have almost no impact, suggesting they are not meaningful for premium prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scatter plots show that Age has the strongest positive correlation with Premium Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Premiums steadily rise with age, highlighting its dominant role in pricing.\n",
    "  * This aligns with insurers‚Äô risk assessment, as older individuals typically face higher health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Height, Weight, and BMI display only weak relationships with Premium Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * These attributes add minor variability but are not strong standalone predictors.\n",
    "  * Their effect is overshadowed by direct medical risk indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Number of Major Surgeries shows a moderate upward trend with Premium Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Customers with more surgeries generally face higher premiums.\n",
    "  * This reinforces the importance of medical history in driving costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, Age and medical history are the strongest predictors of premiums, while body metrics contribute only marginally.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boxplot \n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Health conditions such as **Diabetes, Blood Pressure Problems, Allergies, and Cancer History** show only modest differences in premium prices (4‚Äì9%).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * These conditions raise premiums slightly but do not drastically alter pricing.\n",
    "  * This indicates they are considered moderate risk factors in premium calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chronic Diseases** lead to a much higher premium impact (\\~14.3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Customers with chronic illnesses consistently face elevated costs.\n",
    "  * This reflects insurers‚Äô recognition of ongoing medical expenses and higher long-term risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Organ Transplants** stand out with the largest effect (\\~32%).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Premiums are significantly higher for customers with transplant history.\n",
    "  * This condition represents a critical health risk, strongly influencing pricing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, severe and long-term health risks such as transplants and chronic diseases drive the largest premium differences, while moderate conditions show only incremental effects.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pairplots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîé Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individuals with diabetes show slightly higher BMI and weight clustering compared to non-diabetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This suggests a link between metabolic risk factors and diabetes occurrence.\n",
    "  * Higher BMI-driven health risks can increase premium pricing, requiring insurers to account for obesity-related conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blood pressure problems are more common in older age groups, but BMI and weight overlap heavily across both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This indicates that age is a stronger differentiator than body composition for hypertension.\n",
    "  * Premium adjustments for blood pressure should emphasize age-related risk rather than BMI alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transplants are rare but associated with very high premium clusters regardless of age or weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This highlights that the medical event itself, rather than lifestyle factors, drives premium costs.\n",
    "  * Models should treat transplant history as a categorical high-risk driver, even if sample frequency is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chronic diseases are spread across all age groups but tend to align with higher premium bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This indicates a broad impact on insurance pricing irrespective of BMI or weight.\n",
    "  * Chronic disease indicators should be prioritized as consistent premium escalators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Known allergies show minimal separation across age, BMI, or premium bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This suggests allergies alone may not significantly alter health risk or pricing.\n",
    "  * They may only add predictive value when combined with other comorbidities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Family history of cancer shows moderate overlap with higher premiums but without strong clustering by BMI or weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This reflects genetic risk being independent of lifestyle variables.\n",
    "  * Insurers may use family history as an additive but not dominant pricing factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, major health events like transplants and chronic diseases are the most consistent premium escalators, while lifestyle risks (BMI, weight) primarily act as amplifiers for diabetes and hypertension.**\n",

    "\n",
    "* Age and height show no outliers, indicating a clean and consistent distribution across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weight has 16 outliers above the upper bound, suggesting a subset of individuals with significantly higher body mass, potentially reflecting obesity risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of major surgeries also has 16 outliers, highlighting a small group with unusually high surgical history, which signals elevated health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Premium price has 6 outliers above ‚Çπ38.5k, representing customers with extreme risk profiles where insurers impose substantially higher charges.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Both methods agree that age and height are clean with no significant outliers, showing stable distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weight and BMI emerge as the main sources of outliers, with IQR detecting more (22 BMI vs 7 in Z-Score), suggesting sensitivity to heavier tails in BMI distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Premium price shows a few high-end outliers (6 via IQR) but none flagged by Z-Score, indicating extreme premiums are still within statistical bounds when using standard deviation‚Äìbased thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, the dataset has a very low percentage of outliers (<3%), all retained for modeling since they represent meaningful high-risk individuals rather than data errors.\n",
